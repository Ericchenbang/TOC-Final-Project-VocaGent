      "content": "Chinese robotaxis could be set to hit UK roads in 2026 as ride-sharing apps Uber and Lyft announce partnerships with Baidu to trial the tech.\nThe two companies are hoping to obtain approval from regulators to test the autonomous vehicles in London.\nBaidu's Apollo Go driverless taxi service already operates in dozens of cities, mostly in China, and has accrued millions of rides without a human behind the wheel.\nTransport secretary Heidi Alexander said the news was \"another vote of confidence in our plans for self-driving vehicles\" - but many remain sceptical about their safety.\n\"We're planning for self-driving cars to carry passengers for the first time from spring, under our pilot scheme – harnessing this technology safely and responsibly to transform travel,\" Ms Alexander said in a post on X .\nUber said in June it would bring its plans to trial UK driverless cars forward as the government sought to accelerate framework to allow pilots of small autonomous \"bus and taxi like\" commercial services in 2026.\n\"We're excited to accelerate Britain's leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year,\" it said of its Baidu partnership on Monday.\nLyft said in August it would look to deploy driverless taxis in the UK and Germany as part of a European agreement with Baidu.\nIt already operates \"autonomous rides\" in Atlanta, US - where Uber also operates a robotaxi service through its partnership with Waymo.\nLyft chief executive David Risher said in a post on X on Monday London passengers would be \"the first in the region to experience Baidu's Apollo Go vehicles\".\nBut both firms still need to convince regulators.\nMr Risher said if green lit, Lyft's initial fleet of dozens of Baidu Apollo Go cars would begin testing next year \"with plans to scale to hundreds from there\".\nBut Jack Stilgoe, professor of science and technology policy at University College London, said driverless cars \"can't just scale up like other digital technologies\".\n\"There's a big difference between having a few test vehicles using public streets as their laboratory and a fully-developed, scaled-up system that becomes a real transport option for people,\" he told the BBC.\nSelf-driving vehicles have often been lauded as the future of transport, with some claiming they make fewer errors than human drivers.\nBut many people remain uneasy about the safety of taxis without a human operator.\nAlmost 60% of UK respondents to a YouGov poll in October said they would not feel comfortable riding in a driverless taxi under any circumstances.\nMany also expressed a lack of trust in the tech, with 85% saying they would opt for a cab with a human driver if given the same price and convenience.\nInstances of autonomous vehicles making mistakes, trapping passengers in cars and causing traffic jams or accidents also continue to make headlines.\nSelf-driving taxi operator Waymo reportedly suspended its service in San Francisco on Saturday after some of its vehicles stopped working during a power cut.\nProf Stilgoe said amid concerns about their safety, as well as privacy and the potential to add to congestion, the UK should lead in \"setting standards for the technology\".\n\"London has been really successful at getting cars out of its city centre,\" he said.\n\"When it comes to traffic, the only thing worse than a single-occupancy car is a zero-occupancy one.\"\nSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

      "title": "Gold and silver hit records as investors hunt for safety",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd74ldr2zryo",
      "content": "The gold price has hit another record high, trading above $4,400 (£3,275) an ounce for the first time.\nThe price of the precious metal has risen on expectations the US central bank will cut interest rates further next year, analysts said.\nGold started the year worth $2,600 an ounce, but geopolitical tensions, the Trump tariffs and expectations of rate cuts have added to investor demand for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities.\nThe prices of other precious metals also rose on Monday, with silver hitting a record high as well.\nThe gold price has risen more than 68% this year, the highest increase since 1979, according to Adrian Ash, director of research at gold bullion marketplace BullionVault.\n2025 has seen \"slow-burning trends around interest rates, around war and trade tensions\", Mr Ash said, which have helped to push up the price of gold.\n\"The precious metals market says that President Trump has really triggered something – and gold has gone crazy this year.\n\"You've got the trade war, the attacks on the US Federal Reserve and you've got geopolitical tensions, all of those provocations come from Trump,\" he said.\nAfter passing the $4,400 an ounce mark on Monday, the spot price of gold hit a high of $4,426.66.\nLower interest rate expectations typically mean lower returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to commodities such as gold and silver to get a return, but also diversify their portfolios.\nThe consensus among analysts currently is that the US will lower interest rates twice in 2026.\nAnother factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026.\nThe steady increase in the price of gold across the year could be because it is seen as a way for traders to help shield themselves from the threat of inflation and economic turmoil, Anita Wright, chartered financial planner at Ribble Wealth Management, said.\n\"When confidence in financial assets and policy stability starts to wobble, gold tends to respond first as the primary monetary metal,\" Ms Wright said.\nA weaker US dollar has also helped push gold prices higher by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.\nOther precious metals have also had record years. The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.\nFor 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts.\nUnlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.\nSeparately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.\nThe price of Brent crude rose $1.31 to $61.78 a barrel, while US oil was up $1.25 at $57.77. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year."

      "title": "Why the railways often seem to be in such chaos over Christmas",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdg795m5epo",
      "content": "At a rail yard near Milton Keynes, a group of men in orange outfits are making final checks on huge slabs of railway track, preparing them so that they are ready to be installed over Christmas and New Year.\nAt a time when many commuters stop work to enjoy celebrations with friends and family, rail bosses get massive engineering projects and upgrades done.\nSo, those orange-clad workers are out in force.\nCarl Foy has been on duty for roughly 20 of the 27 Christmases in his career. This year will add another to the tally - with his two grown-up sons, who are also rail workers, out there with him. Some friends think he's mad for doing it. But Carl says it's just accepted as part of the job.\n\"We bring in a few mince pies, the site offices might have a bit of tinsel around,\" he says. \"We make it as enjoyable as we can and just crack on with the work.\"\nThe £26m project they'll be working on this Christmas is one of the biggest scheduled across the country: Hanslope Junction, a crucial part of the West Coast Main Line, which is wearing out.\nEach day almost 500 trains use it and an increasing number of faults are causing delays, the repercussions of which ripple throughout the network. Now, the whole thing, comprising four tracks, is to be re-laid.\nIt's a giant and complicated jigsaw puzzle of 130 separate track panels - not something that can be done when trains are roaring up and down. So, it will leave passengers with no trains between Milton Keynes and Rugby and Milton Keynes and Northampton not just late on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day (as is usually the case) but up until the morning of 5 January. It means no direct trains linking London Euston with north-west England and Scotland for 11 full days.\nIt's a similar story up and down the country, with other projects, too, like updating signalling technology. In all, 5% of the rail network will be shut down over the festive period - part of a £160m engineering project organised by Network Rail.\nMany of these are huge jobs, not routine maintenance, that have been long planned, with funding allocated as part of Network Rail's five-yearly business plans.\nThe question is - with millions travelling across the country over the festive season, causing so much inconvenience to many, why schedule it now? And is it all a case of sensible planning - or an indicator of something amiss with Britain's rail network?\nChatting to passengers at London Euston station weeks before Christmas, it doesn't take long to find some who are affected.\n\"My sister-in-law is coming to visit and she's had real trouble trying to get a train,\" one woman tells me. \"Every train's got two or three changes.\" Unable to find a direct service, and with a longer journey time, she changed the dates of her visit to avoid the disruption.\nAnother passenger, heading for the North of England, is wondering whether to get the train at all. \"It's easier for me to drive rather than run the risk of getting there and not being able to get back.\n\"Obviously there are a lot less commuters over the Christmas period, I can see why they do it at this time of year, but it's not great if you're trying to get home… to see your friends and family.\"\nThe debate over why works should be scheduled over Christmas is a complex one: on the one hand, train bosses calculate that the effects on people travelling to work will be minimal, given how many businesses shut for Christmas.\n\"It's the quietest time of year for the railway and our customers, so we squeeze in as much work then to disrupt as few people as possible,\" explains Jake Kelly, a regional managing director at Network Rail.\nBut on the other hand it risks causing a \"bottleneck\", argues Gareth Dennis, a rail engineer, campaigner, and author of How the Railways Will Fix the Future.\nHe sees another problem too: \"It's extremely expensive.\n\"All those workers, rightly, are getting paid way over the normal rate they would because they are sacrificing extremely important family and personal time working long hours over that period.\"\nMr Kelly acknowledges there is a price: \"It's always a difficult choice, and there is a cost of doing work over Christmas when families across the UK are celebrating.\"\nBut, he says, it's a difficult trade-off between minimising disruption for customers versus cost.\nWhen compared with other European countries, Britain is fairly unique (with the exception of Italy) in its \"particularly intensive approach\", as Mr Dennis puts it, to doing this sort of rail work at Easter and Christmas.\nThis is partly because rail networks in other countries, like Germany and France, are laid out differently.\n\"Where the country's more of a square shape, their rail network isn't kind of north-south, it's much more of a grid,\" he explains. \"So you can dodge around things more easily… and they can spread their engineering work out a bit more.\"\nThe high level of passenger demand in Britain also poses a challenge. \"It has one of the most intensively used railways in Europe - [it] gets tired, gets worn out\".\nThe West Coast Main Line does not have the capacity to run any more trains, while the East Coast Mainline's new December timetable will make it much busier, he says.\nBut even this is only part of the story. Another factor that contributes to the network creaking in places is a legacy of underinvestment.\nStewart Palmer spent 38 years working on the railway, including spells at Network Rail's predecessor Railtrack, and as the managing director of what was then called South West Trains.\nIn the past – as far back as the post-war period - the money wasn't always there to do the work that was needed and for decades there was a tendency, he says, \"towards mend and make do\".\nThe fact there is so much work to do now \"has emerged over a very long history\".\nEngineering works have frequently been postponed, he adds. One way of keeping the railway running safely until work can be done has been by imposing speed restrictions on some parts of the track.\nBut the legacy of a Hertfordshire rail crash that happened 25 years ago is a reminder of the importance of ensuring that deteriorated rail is replaced in good time.\nOn a Tuesday in October 2000, a train carrying 12 staff and 170 passengers came to a catastrophic halt outside the town of Hatfield. Four of the nine carriages were derailed and three more were flung over on their side, killing four people.\nAn official investigation into the crash revealed a series of errors by rail bosses and engineers. One of those causes, highlighted by an inquiry, was a failure to identify and repair or replace the rapidly deteriorating rail.\n\"This caused us to do loads of engineering investigations, but it also resulted in renewing an enormous amount of rail all at once in a very fast period of time,\" Mr Dennis explains.\nThen there is the impact of the weather. Network Rail has been clear that climate change poses a significant challenge. \"Extreme weather caused by climate change is on the rise. This will affect how safely and reliably we can run the railway,\" it says on its website.\nThese extreme weather events not only lead to equipment failures but affect how quickly things wear out too.\nWilliam Powrie, a professor of Geotechnical Engineering at the University of Southampton, says climate change creates a long list of hazards for the railways. Take the hot summers - these heat railway tracks beyond temperatures they can handle, sometimes causing them to buckle, he says. High winds can also damage overhead lines.\nHe's particularly worried about what he calls the \"paperclip\" effect.\nMany British railways are built on clay soil that shrinks in the summer as vegetation sucks out water, and expands in the winter. But this expand-and-shrink cycle is becoming more extreme, he warns.\n\"It's a bit like if you get a paperclip and bend it forwards, bend it backwards. It's OK for a bit - but eventually it will break.\"\nIt's not only tracks that need looking after, but embankments and drainage along railway lines. In November, a train travelling from Glasgow to London on the West Coast Main Line derailed near Carlisle after hitting a landslip , leaving four people injured.\nAn independent investigation into the cause of a train derailment will look into a raft of potential issues. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch said its preliminary examination found a drainage channel was \"unable to accommodate the volume of water which was present\".\nNetwork Rail say they are aware of climate change-related hazards - and they are moving money around to cope with it. Their latest five-year business plan earmarked £2.8bn to help deal with extreme weather and climate change.\nAmid all of this, the organisation has committed to make cost savings of £3.9bn. Bosses have been clear about the financial pressures they face.\n\"Like many businesses, we continue to feel the impact of inflation and rising supply chain costs,\" Andrew Haines, Network Rail's then-chief executive said in an update this summer.\nThis means \"tough choices\", including \"prioritising assets that are located on busier parts of the network,\" he said.\nBut the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, has warned that constrained funding forcing Network Rail to spend \"less on renewals and more on life-extending repairs and maintenance\" could mean \"more asset failures and therefore disruption to train services in the long-term\", plus potential higher costs in the future.\nOf course, for millions of passengers this Christmas, their main priority will simply be getting home. People are being warned to check and plan ahead before they travel - a message as reliably present at this time of year as Christmas trees or mulled wine.\nSo, can railway passengers around the country expect a smoother Christmas next year?\nUnlikely, argues Jake Kelly of Network Rail. A project like Hanslope Junction near Milton Keynes can be years in the planning.\nWith \"a pipeline that is three or four years long\", he says \"we're already starting to finalise [plans] for next year\".\nAdditional reporting: Florence Freeman.\nTop image credit: Getty Images.\nBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

      "title": "Why Croatia's capital wants to hold Europe's best Christmas market",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dy5m56477o",
      "content": "Christmas markets are not just tradition across Europe, they are big businesses that give cities a huge economic boost every December. For Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, it is an effective way of attracting tourists outside of the country's main summer season.\nThe words \"tourism\" and \"Croatia\" are likely to conjure visons of sparkling Adriatic vistas during the hottest months of the year.\nTourism accounts for more than a fifth of the economy of this Balkan country, and it is keen to encourage more visitors to arrive outside of the height of summer. Yuletide frolics are a key part of that strategy.\n\"We're making a transformation,\" says Croatia's Tourism Minister, Tonci Glavina.\n\"We are developing as a year-round tourism destination – we are not a summer destination anymore. Croatia has really made a significant development. At some point way back it was just sun and sea, but now Croatia offers many tourism products all across the country.\"\nZagreb Advent, as the capital's Christmas markets and events are collectively known, is the poster child for this approach, with billboards in neighbouring countries urging people to attend. In fact, this year the campaign has spread as far as London's tube stations and Milan's buses.\nThere are even special trains to bring visitors from Slovenia and Hungary. All of it is part of Zagreb's push, in a very crowded field, to become one of Europe's most popular Christmas markets.\nWhile some cities might limit their offering to a single location, Zagreb Advent is a multi-venue spectacular that takes over large chunks of the centre.\n\"The entire city has become a festive ground for celebrating Christmas throughout the whole of December,\" says Slavica Olujic Klapcic, who manages one of the Christmas market areas.\n\"What's really special around here is that each of the locations has its own theme, and it's a little bit different in decoration, and in the content that it offers. So for a visitor, I think it's a good deal, because by taking a walk through Zagreb, you can see many different spots.\"\nLike other Christmas markets across Europe there are no shortages of the usual seasonal staples, such as sausages and mulled wine. But there are also multiple music stages, craft stalls, vendors offering traditional Croatian food, art installations, and an enormous ice rink.\n\"It brings life to Zagreb,\" reckons Zrinka Farina, who is involved with putting on Christmas market events outside the city's historic Hotel Esplanade, as well as a food and music market at nearby Strossmayer Square called Fuliranje – which roughly translates as \"fooling around\".\nBut she says that Croatians are deadly serious about trying to offer Europe's best Christmas market. \"We are such a sporty nation, we love to compete – and when we do something, we really want to be the best in the world in it.\"\nSuch has been the effort that the city has put into Zagreb Advent since it was first held in 2014 that it was voted the best Christmas market in Europe for three years in a row , from 2015 to 2017.\nThe competition is organised by travel website European Best Destinations, and Zagreb's success has helped to drive visitor numbers to the city every December.\nBack in 2014, the city saw 100,198 people stay for at least one night during the last month of the year. By 2024 this had more than doubled to 245,352, which the tourist board says gave the city a €100m ($117m; £88m) economic boost.\nHowever, Zagreb has a long way to go if it wishes to catch up with Europe's Christmas market heavyweights.\nThe one held in the German city of Cologne is widely reported to be the most popular. It is expected to attract four million visitors this year, with an economic impact of €229m.\nMeanwhile, Austria's capital Vienna attracts around 2.8 million visitors to its Christmas market, and France's Strasbourg gets two million people.\nZagreb's event also has a limited history – it is only in its 11th year. By contrast, Dresden's Christmas market, widely considered to be the world's oldest, was first held in 1434. Strasbourg's began in 1570, Vienna in 1764 and Cologne in 1820.\nDespite its infancy, Zagreb Advent is said to be attracting visitors from across Europe. \"They come here from Italy, Spain, Bosnia, Slovenia and even the UK,\" says Lucija Vrkljan, who is working as a steward at the ice rink.\n\"It's a great place to be,\" says Dario Kozul, the founder of BioMania, a bistro with a stall offering vegan and gluten-free food at the Hotel Esplanade Christmas market.  \"We have a cross-marketing situation all the time,\" he adds.\n\"People walk into this event and test our food – they're really very pleased with it. Then we talk about our restaurant, and within the next couple of days, we see them there.\"\nMarko Peric, dean of the Faculty of Tourism at Croatia's University of Rijeka, agrees that Zagreb Advent brings \"unusually high\" numbers of arrivals and overnight stays in December.\nBut he cautions that the rest of Croatia's heavy reliance on the summer season is a weakness that still needs to be addressed. \"We need to work and develop our tourist offer in other parts of the year, including the winter,\" he says.\n\"We don't have snow, but we can offer a lot. We should rely on our gastronomy, which is well known, with many tourists arriving just because of that. And we could use other types of events like carnival in February, or sporting events.\"\nTourism Minister Tonci Glavina insists that Croatia is making moves in the right direction. He points out that visitor numbers over July and August were actually slightly down on the same period in 2024.\nBut the country is still on course for a record-breaking year, thanks to significant growth either side of the summer peak, with around 5% more arrivals in June and September. This, says the minister, is \"just perfect\", as is the 10% year-on-year rise over the first week of December.\n\"We are transforming Croatia to be a sustainable tourism destination, meaning about the same number of guests in peak season, developing the shoulder seasons, and of course developing other parts of the country to be main tourism destinations.\"\nZagreb Advent has already shown the benefits. Although that may not be the first thing that springs to a visitor's mind with all the traditional Croatian treats on offer.\nAfter all, what could be better than some post-skate fritule doughnuts, except perhaps a fritule with chocolate sauce."

      "title": "This billionaire tested China's limits. It cost him his freedom",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yqr485d84o",
      "content": "On a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.\nThey had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory.\nThey would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.\nIn prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"\nBut neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.\nDecades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy.\nThat proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.\nLai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave.\n\"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.\nHe wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.\nLai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial.\nIt said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.\nLai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\n\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".\nMonday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".\nBack in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.\nLai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"\nPeace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.\nFor Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.\nApple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.\nFrom a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nFormer editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.\nThey describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"\nIt had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.\nThat was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"\nAn early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.\nIt became a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.\nAfter carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.\nLife in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.\nDecades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"\nUncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"\nAnd so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.\nThe day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.\nBy his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.\nBusiness often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.\nThe book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.\nAfter a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.\nLai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.\nThen in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square : a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.\nGiordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.\nA million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.\nLai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".\nThe following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".\nBeijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\n\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.\nHe soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.\nHe became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997.\n\"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"\nDuring the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.\nThe 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.\nProtesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.\nThe movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.\nWhat began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.\nLai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"\nApple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.\nGovernment adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".\nWhether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.\nLai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.\nDuring the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".\nAll of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\n\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".\nBeijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.\nLee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"\nLai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.\nCarmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".\nShe is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai.\n\"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\""

      "content": "The maker of Jim Beam bourbon whiskey says it will halt production at its main site in Kentucky for all of next year.\nThe distillery will stay closed while the firm takes \"the opportunity to invest in site enhancements,\" it told the BBC in a statement on Sunday.\n\"We are always assessing production levels to best meet consumer demand and recently met with our team to discuss our volumes for 2026.\"\nDistillers in Kentucky - famous for its bourbon - face uncertainty, in part, due to US President Donald Trump's trade policies.\nThe brand is owned by Japanese drinks giant Suntory Global Spirits, which employs more than 1,000 people across its sites in Kentucky.\nThe firm said its other operations in the state, including a separate distillery and its bottling and warehousing plants, would continue to run next year. The visitor centre in Kentucky also remains open.\nJim Beam also said it was assessing how it would use its workforce during the production pause, and was holding talks with the workers' union.\nIn October, the Kentucky Distillers' Association (KDA) trade body said the amount of bourbon in warehouses across the state was at a record high of more than 16 million barrels .\nAccording to the association, the barrels of bourbon, which are taxed by the state, have cost distillers \"a crushing\" $75m (£56m) this year.\nUS distillers have faced retaliatory import taxes on their goods after Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" announcement in April saw the US imposing tariffs on most countries around the world.\n\"Much of the expansion over the last decade has been geared towards global growth,\" the KDA said in October as it called for a \"for a speedy return to reciprocal, tariff-free trade\".\nTrade tensions between the US and Canada have also affected sales of alcohol, with most Canadian provinces boycotting American spirits earlier in the year."

      "title": "Lush co-founder takes pride in being a 'woke nerd'",
      "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrj9529yn5o",
      "content": "Most companies and bosses would squirm at the idea of being called \"woke\" and may even regard it as an insult. But not Mark Constantine.\nLush's outspoken co-founder and chief executive wears it like a badge of honour and is not ashamed of turning it into a business philosophy.\nThe firm is renowned for putting activism at the heart of its bright bath bombs business, tackling a range of issues from trans rights to police accountability.\nThe 73-year-old is still steering the empire with the same principles that have defined its three decades on the High Street, which has seen it expand from a small Dorset store into a global brand with 869 outlets and an annual turnover of £690m.\nLush has taken some of the boldest stances in British retail including shutting down some of its social media accounts over concerns about the impact on young people, and more recently closing stores for a day to protest against starvation in Gaza .\n\"I like being woke,\" admits Constantine.\nA self-confessed \"over-achiever and a nerd\" who loves learning, he is up before the crack of dawn for his main passion - writing about birdsong - in between his meditation and Alexander technique, a therapy for good posture and movement.\nBut his message is crystal clear to those who openly resent his values: \"You shouldn't come in my shop.\"\nIt's a strong statement in an era when many businesses avoid political or cultural debates for fear of alienating customers and risking profits.\nBen & Jerry's has long worn its social activism on its sleeve, which has caused tension with its parent company.\nWhere Lush has remained an independent firm, Constantine believes selling out means sacrificing the business's values.\n\"If you've sold your business to someone else, I think you're asking a lot for them to do everything you want. What should Ben and Jerry have done? They should never have sold.\"\nBen & Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen maintains they were opposed to selling but as a publicly-traded company, says US regulations forced their hand and the brand's social mission was written into the contract with the parent company.\n\"I have a huge appreciation for Lush, their values, and how they use their most powerful tool - their voice - to advocate for those values,\" Cohen told the BBC, following Constantine's Big Boss interview, adding, \"I'm not 'asking' for anything.\"\nSpeaking to the BBC's Big Boss Interview podcast in the busy run-up to Christmas, Lush's Constantine says preparing for the festive period is \"very like war\".\n\"You have your troops, you have your supplies. Everything's organised and ready. And then it's just a question of when will the onslaught occur?\"\nHe suggests that men may be more likely to be out buying last-minute presents, saying with a laugh the company sees a lot of men \"who come in on Christmas Eve and tell us they're regulars\".\nBut the key to attracting shoppers in the first place is by making retail \"fun\", says Constantine.\nLush has turned shopping into more of an experience with offerings such as spa treatments and parties for customers.\nAnd it's experiences such as these that could help reverse the High Street's declining prospects, he believes.\nWhile some business leaders have suggested that a rise in employers' National Insurance contributions and in the minimum wage could result in hiring freezes, Constantine views it differently.\n\"It's good news for everyone and it's good for the economy because you've got more money coming into the economy at the biggest point.\n\"The people who are getting these raises are at the bottom.\n\"I'm delighted to pay the extra money to get the staff up to a proper level, and I think we should celebrate that.\"\nHowever Lush's pay record is not without blemish. In 2020, it admitted to underpaying its Australian workers more than $4m over nearly a decade. A company spokesperson told the BBC after the Big Boss interview: \"We made mistakes, we found those mistakes and have paid the money we owed, and we are ensuring those errors cannot happen again.\"\nIn the same year Lush faced claims of poor working conditions at its Australian factory. The spokesperson added: \"Since these concerns were raised we swiftly developed an action plan to address the areas of concern.\"\nLush is privately owned by all six co-founders – Constantine and his wife Mo, Rowena Bird, Helen Ambrosen, Liz Bennett and Paul Greeves – all of whom started the business in 1995 and have remained active since.\nTwo of Constantine's three children also work for the company, which is particularly pleasing for a man who believes family is at the heart of a successful business and is key to longevity.\n\"Family businesses give better returns on investment at every level,\" he says, claiming they last longer because they ride out the good times and the bad.\nIt's a lesson he learned from the late Dame Anita Roddick, founder of The Body Shop where it all began for Constantine in 1977 – manufacturing and supplying products to Roddick's stores.\nHowever, he says the government does not understand \"the strength of family businesses\" after it announced that from April 2026 family business assets of more than £1m will face inheritance tax when passed on to relatives.\nHe believes this tax will force many owners to sell up, which is the \"real worry on succession\".\nA spokesperson for the Treasury said the government was \"pro-business\", pointing out that it had capped corporation tax at 25% and was reforming business rates.\n\"Right now, 53% of Business Property Relief – worth £533m – goes to just 158 estates. Our reforms will channel that funding into vital public services,\" the spokesperson said.\nNevertheless, Constantine remains bullish about the future of bricks-and-mortar shopping.\nBut he thinks modern retailing would benefit from a return to the old-fashioned values that once defined British retail, in particular innovation and kindness.\n\"I like to serve. I like the Jeeves kind of feeling,\" he says with a grin."
